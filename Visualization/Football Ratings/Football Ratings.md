# Football Player Ratings Analytics

## 🔍 Overview
This project analyzes football player rating data to understand performance patterns, consistency, and comparative strengths across players. The notebook applies data analysis techniques to transform raw rating records into interpretable insights relevant for performance evaluation and scouting contexts.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective is to evaluate player performance using rating data, identify trends and variability, and demonstrate how analytical methods can support objective decision-making in sports analytics.

## 🧠 Methodology
The project follows a standard analytical pipeline:
- Data loading and validation.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study distributions, averages, and variability.
- Comparative analysis across players and metrics.
- Visualization of performance indicators for clear interpretation.

## 📊 Key Results
- Identification of top-performing players based on rating distributions.
- Insights into consistency versus volatility in player performance.
- Visual comparisons that highlight relative strengths and weaknesses.
- A reproducible notebook suitable for extension into predictive or ranking models.
