# Urban Waste Analytics & Forecasting

## 🔍 Overview
This project analyzes urban solid waste data to identify patterns in generation, composition, and temporal behavior. Using exploratory data analysis and time-series techniques, the notebook transforms raw municipal waste records into structured insights that support operational planning and policy decisions.

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective is to understand how urban waste evolves over time and across categories, and to generate analytical outputs that can inform forecasting, optimization of collection processes, and sustainability strategies.

## 🧠 Methodology
The workflow follows a structured data science pipeline:
- Data ingestion and validation from structured datasets.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure consistency and analytical reliability.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, distributions, and anomalies.
- Temporal analysis to evaluate seasonality and growth behavior.
- Visualization of key indicators to support interpretability and decision-making.

## 📊 Key Results
- Identification of dominant waste categories and their relative weight over time.
- Clear temporal trends that reveal growth patterns and seasonal fluctuations.
- Visual evidence of variability that highlights opportunities for operational optimization.
- A reproducible analytical notebook suitable for extension into forecasting or optimization models.
