# Student Performance Analytics

## 🔍 Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to understand academic outcomes and the factors associated with variation in results. The notebook applies data analysis techniques to explore patterns across subjects, demographics, and performance indicators, transforming raw educational data into structured insights.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective is to evaluate student performance trends, identify disparities and patterns in academic results, and demonstrate how data analytics can support evidence-based decision-making in educational contexts.

## 🧠 Methodology
The analytical process follows a clear data science workflow:
- Data ingestion and inspection of student-level records.
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine score distributions and relationships between variables.
- Comparative analysis across subjects and student groups.
- Visualization of academic performance indicators.

## 📊 Key Results
- Identification of performance distributions across subjects.
- Insights into variability and gaps between different student groups.
- Visual evidence of trends that can inform academic support strategies.
- A reproducible notebook suitable for extension into predictive or intervention-focused models.
