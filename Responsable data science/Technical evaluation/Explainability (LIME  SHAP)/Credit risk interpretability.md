🔍 Overview

This project implements model interpretability techniques to explain credit risk predictions generated by a machine learning classifier. Using local and global explanation methods, the solution provides transparent insights into how individual features influence approval or rejection decisions, enabling trust, auditability, and regulatory alignment in credit scoring systems.

🎯 Objective

To enhance the transparency of a credit risk prediction model by applying interpretable AI techniques that clearly explain individual predictions and overall feature importance, supporting informed decision-making in financial risk management.

🧠 Methodology

A supervised machine learning model was trained to predict credit risk outcomes. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) were applied to analyze individual predictions, while SHAP values were used to quantify global and local feature contributions. The workflow integrates data preprocessing, model inference, and explainability layers without altering the original predictive performance.

📊 Key Results

The interpretability analysis revealed the most influential financial and demographic features affecting credit decisions. LIME explanations provided clear, instance-level reasoning for specific applicants, while SHAP visualizations highlighted consistent global patterns across the dataset, confirming model behavior and reducing the risk of hidden bias.

🧩 Why This Project Matters

In high-stakes financial environments, black-box models are not acceptable. This project demonstrates how predictive accuracy can be combined with transparency, enabling compliance with regulatory requirements, improving stakeholder trust, and supporting responsible deployment of machine learning systems in credit decision processes.
