# Social Mining Enhancement — Resource Interaction Analysis (pm4py)

## 🔍 Overview
This project applies **social mining techniques** to an event log in order to analyze how resources (people or roles) interact during process execution.
Using **pm4py**, the analysis derives collaboration and handoff relationships directly from event data, revealing organizational patterns that are not visible through control-flow models alone.

The focus is on exploratory analysis with full transparency of intermediate outputs.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze interactions between resources involved in process execution  
- Identify collaboration patterns and handoff relationships  
- Detect potential coordination issues or workload imbalances  
- Complement control-flow analysis with organizational insights

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- Load and validate the event log using pm4py  
- Ensure resource information is consistently represented  
- Derive social relations from event sequences (e.g., handoffs between resources)  
- Compute descriptive metrics and visualize interaction structures when applicable  
- Preserve all intermediate outputs for interpretability and reproducibility

---

## 📊 Key Results
- Visibility into how work is transferred between resources  
- Identification of central or highly connected resources  
- Evidence of collaboration structures and potential bottlenecks  
- A reproducible social mining workflow applicable to real-world processes

## 🧩 Why This Project Matters
Social mining extends process mining by focusing on **who performs the work**, not only **how the work flows**.
This project demonstrates how event logs can be used to uncover collaboration dynamics, handoff inefficiencies, and organizational structures, supporting better operational diagnostics, staffing decisions, and process improvement initiatives.
