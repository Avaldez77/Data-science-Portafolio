# Process Mining – General Topics Summary

## 🔹 Core Themes
- Event logs as the foundation for process analysis  
- Data-driven understanding of real process behavior  
- Emphasis on transparency, interpretability, and reproducibility  

## 🔹 Exploratory Process Mining
- Inspection of traces, activities, and variants  
- Identification of dominant and infrequent execution paths  
- Analysis of process variability and deviations  
- No prior assumptions or predefined models  

## 🔹 Process Discovery
- Automatic reconstruction of process models from event logs  
- Extraction of control-flow relations (ordering, branching, concurrency)  
- Use of interpretable models as analytical baselines  
- Support for further analysis such as conformance and performance  

## 🔹 Social Mining
- Analysis of how resources interact during process execution  
- Detection of handoffs, collaboration patterns, and central actors  
- Insight into organizational structure and coordination dynamics  
- Complements control-flow analysis with human-centric insights  

## 🔹 Methodological Principles
- Preservation of intermediate analytical outputs  
- Reproducible workflows using standardized tools  
- Clear linkage between raw data and insights  

## 🔹 Practical Relevance
- Operational diagnostics and process improvement  
- Identification of inefficiencies and bottlenecks  
- Better decision-making based on actual execution data  
- Applicability to real-world business processes
