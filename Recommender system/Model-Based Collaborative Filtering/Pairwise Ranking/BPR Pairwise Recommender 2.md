# BPR Pairwise Recommender – Implicit Feedback

## 🔍 Overview
This project presents a **portfolio-grade implementation** of a recommender system based on **Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)**.  
The model is designed for **implicit feedback data** and learns user preferences through a **pairwise ranking objective**, focusing on relative item ordering rather than explicit score prediction.

The notebook preserves original execution outputs while presenting the content in a clean, professional, and industry-oriented format.
