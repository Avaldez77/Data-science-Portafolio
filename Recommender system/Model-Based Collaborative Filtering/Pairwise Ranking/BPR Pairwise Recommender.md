# Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) – Implicit Feedback Recommender

## 🔍 Overview
This project presents a **portfolio-grade implementation and customization** of a recommender system based on **Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)**.  
The model is designed for **implicit feedback data**, learning user preferences through pairwise ranking rather than explicit ratings.

The notebook preserves original execution outputs while refining structure and language for professional and industry-focused review.
