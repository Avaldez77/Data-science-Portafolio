# ALS Recommender System – Implicit Feedback (Customization)

## 🔍 Overview
This project showcases a **portfolio-grade implementation and customization** of an **Alternating Least Squares (ALS)** recommender system built on **implicit feedback data**.  
The notebook preserves original execution outputs while refining structure, language, and presentation for professional review.

The focus is on understanding how model configuration choices impact recommendation behavior in real-world scenarios.

## 🎯 Objective
- Customize and fine-tune an ALS-based recommender system  
- Work with implicit interaction signals instead of explicit ratings  
- Analyze the impact of hyperparameters on model behavior  
- Present a clean, reproducible, and industry-ready implementation  

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- Build a sparse **user–item interaction matrix** from implicit signals  
- Train an ALS model using matrix factorization  
- Customize key hyperparameters (latent factors, regularization, iterations)  
- Preserve and analyze original model outputs and intermediate results  
- Generate personalized top-N recommendations
