# Time Series Analysis Project

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on the practical analysis of time series data, applying classical and modern techniques to understand patterns, structure, and temporal dynamics within real-world datasets. The work emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and analytical rigor rather than theoretical exposition.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze temporal data to identify trends, seasonality, and residual components  
- Apply decomposition and forecasting techniques commonly used in data science and analytics  
- Build a clean, reusable workflow suitable for academic or professional portfolios  

## 🧠 Methodology
- Exploratory analysis of time-indexed data  
- Visualization of temporal behavior  
- Decomposition of time series (additive and multiplicative models)  
- Application of smoothing and forecasting techniques  
- Interpretation of results with a focus on real-world implications  

## 📊 Key Results
- Clear identification of trend and seasonal patterns  
- Improved understanding of underlying data structure  
- Forecasts aligned with observed historical behavior  
- Visual outputs that support data-driven decision-making  

## 🛠 Technologies & Skills
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Time Series Decomposition  
- Forecasting Models
