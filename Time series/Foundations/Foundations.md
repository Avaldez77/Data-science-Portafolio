# Foundations of Time Series Analysis

🔍 **Overview**  
This project focuses on the structural understanding of time series data, emphasizing temporal behavior, trends, and stationarity.

🎯 **Objective**  
Develop a solid conceptual and analytical foundation for working with time-dependent data.

🧠 **Methodology**  
Exploratory visualization, trend inspection, and statistical reasoning to understand temporal structure.

📊 **Key Results**  
Clear identification of time-dependent patterns and non-stationary behavior.

🛠 **Technologies & Skills**  
Python, Time Series Analysis, Data Visualization, Statistical Reasoning

🧩 **Why This Project Matters**  
Understanding the structure of time series is critical before applying any forecasting or modeling techniques.
