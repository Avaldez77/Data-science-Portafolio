# Model Comparison for Regression and Classification

## 🔍 Overview
This project compares multiple machine learning models across regression and classification tasks.

## 🎯 Objective
To select models based on empirical performance and problem context.

## 🧠 Methodology
- Implementation of multiple regression and classification models  
- Cross-validation and metric-based comparison  

## 📊 Key Results
- No single model dominates across tasks  
- Model choice depends on data structure and objective  

## 🛠 Technologies & Skills
- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- Cross-validation  
- Model evaluation  

## 🧩 Why This Project Matters
Demonstrates structured reasoning and evidence-based model selection, essential in production ML systems.
