# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

## 🔍 Overview

This project explores the conceptual and practical differences between supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. It demonstrates how models behave under labeled versus unlabeled data scenarios and highlights when each paradigm is most appropriate. The analysis includes both predictive modeling and structure discovery techniques, supported by empirical experimentation and visual diagnostics.

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- Compare supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies.
- Demonstrate how labeled data enables predictive modeling.
- Illustrate how unsupervised methods uncover hidden structure in data.
- Evaluate performance metrics and interpretability differences between both approaches.
- Provide a clear decision framework for selecting the appropriate learning paradigm.

## 🧠 Methodology

The project is structured into two main analytical sections:

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Train-test split methodology.
- Model training using classification and/or regression algorithms.
- Evaluation using appropriate metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, MSE, R² depending on the task).
- Visualization of model performance and prediction behavior.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering or dimensionality reduction techniques.
- Identification of patterns without labeled targets.
- Visualization of cluster separation or feature structure.
- Interpretation of discovered groupings or latent structure.

Comparative analysis is used to highlight strengths, limitations, and application contexts of both approaches.
