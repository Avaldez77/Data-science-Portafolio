# Exploratory Process Mining (pm4py)

## 🔍 Overview
This project applies exploratory process mining techniques to a real-world event log using the **pm4py** framework.  
The analysis focuses on understanding actual process behavior by examining traces, activity sequences, variants, and execution patterns derived directly from event data.

The work emphasizes transparency and interpretability, preserving all intermediate outputs to enable a clear understanding of how insights are produced.

## 🎯 Objective
- Explore and understand process behavior using event log data  
- Identify dominant execution paths and process variability  
- Analyze trace structures and activity frequencies without predefined models  
- Establish a solid analytical baseline for further process discovery and optimization

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- Load and validate event logs (XES format)  
- Inspect case structures, activities, and timestamps  
- Analyze trace lengths and variant distributions  
- Examine frequency-based and structural process characteristics  
- Use native **pm4py** functionality to ensure reproducibility and methodological clarity

## 📊 Key Results
- Identification of dominant and non-standard process variants  
- Visibility into real execution paths and operational deviations  
- Clear evidence of process variability typical of real-world systems  
- Transparent inspection of intermediate analytical outputs
